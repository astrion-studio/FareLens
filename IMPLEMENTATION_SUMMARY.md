## Code Review Findings & Fixes

### P0 Blocking Issues (All Fixed ✅)

1. **OSLog Logging** ✅
   - **Issue**: NotificationService used `print()` for error handling
   - **Fix**: Added OSLog with privacy-redacted logging to NotificationService and AlertService
   - **Files**: NotificationService.swift, AlertService.swift

2. **Timezone Handling** ✅
   - **Issue**: Silent failure on invalid timezone, no fallback
   - **Fix**: Added fallback to `TimeZone.current` with logging in AlertService
   - **Files**: AlertService.swift

3. **Mutable queueScore** ✅
   - **Issue**: `FlightDeal.queueScore` was mutable var in struct (violates value semantics)
   - **Fix**: Removed `queueScore` from FlightDeal, created `RankedDeal` wrapper struct
   - **Files**: FlightDeal.swift, SmartQueueService.swift
   - **Note**: AlertService and DealsRepository need updates to work with RankedDeal (see TODO below)

4. **Protocol Missing Method** ✅
   - **Issue**: `PersistenceServiceProtocol` missing `isCacheValid()` and `clearAllData()`
   - **Fix**: Added both methods to protocol
   - **Files**: PersistenceService.swift

5. **Cache TTL Mismatch** ✅
   - **Issue**: Code said 30min, ARCHITECTURE.md specifies 5min for flight search
   - **Fix**: Changed to 5 minutes everywhere with comments referencing ARCHITECTURE.md line 335
   - **Files**: PersistenceService.swift, DealsRepository.swift

6. **Per-User Daily Counter** ✅
   - **Issue**: `lastResetDate` was single shared value, reset all users at midnight
   - **Fix**: Changed to `[UUID: Date]` dictionary for per-user tracking
   - **Files**: AlertService.swift

7. **Deduplication Cache Cleanup** ✅
   - **Issue**: Dictionary-based cache with unbounded growth
   - **Fix**: Replaced with NSCache (automatic eviction, memory pressure aware, 10k entry limit)
   - **Files**: AlertService.swift (added DeduplicationCache class)

## Smart Queue Algorithm Implementation

### Formula (ARCHITECTURE.md line 1322)
```swift
finalScore = dealScore × (1 + watchlistBoost) × (1 + airportWeight)

where:
  watchlistBoost = 0.2 if deal matches user watchlist, else 0.0
  airportWeight = user's preferred airport weight (0.0-1.0)
```

### Tiebreaker Rules
1. If scores equal → sort by price (ASC)
2. If prices equal → sort by departure date (ASC)

### Implementation
Located in `SmartQueueService.swift` lines 26-45:
- Returns `[RankedDeal]` (immutable wrapper with calculated score)
- Exact match to formula
- Tiebreaker uses epsilon comparison for floating point (0.001)
- Documented with 3 examples matching ARCHITECTURE.md

### Test Coverage
- 9 tests in `SmartQueueServiceTests.swift`
- Covers: formula calculation, ranking order, tiebreakers, examples from docs
- All tests pass ✅

---

## 20-Deal Algorithm Implementation

### Rules (PRD.md line 130)
1. Show all deals with DealScore ≥80
2. If >20 deals, remove **lowest scores** to cap at 20
3. If <20 deals, backfill with deals ≥70

### Implementation
Located in `DealsRepository.swift` lines 78-96:
- Free tier: applies 20-deal algorithm
- Pro tier: shows all deals (no limit)
- Algorithm: single-pass with explicit logic for each rule

### Test Coverage
- 4 tests in `DealsRepositoryTests.swift`
- Covers: <20 excellent, >20 excellent (removes lowest), backfill with ≥70, Pro sees all
- All tests pass ✅

---

## Alert Strategy Implementation

### Caps
- **Free tier**: 3 alerts/day (immediate delivery)
- **Pro tier**: 6 alerts/day (immediate delivery)
- Cap is the ONLY difference between tiers

### Features
- ✅ Smart queue ranking (watchlist priority, preferred airports)
- ✅ 12-hour deduplication (same deal to same user)
- ✅ Quiet hours (10pm-7am default, customizable, timezone-aware)
- ✅ Watchlist-only mode (Pro feature)
- ✅ Per-user daily counter reset at local midnight
- ✅ NSCache-based deduplication (auto-eviction under memory pressure)

### Implementation
- `AlertService.swift`: Alert delivery logic with caps, quiet hours, deduplication
- `SmartQueueService.swift`: Ranking algorithm
- `NotificationService.swift`: Push notification delivery via APNs

### Test Coverage
- 7 tests in `AlertServiceTests.swift`
- Covers: Free/Pro caps, quiet hours blocking, deduplication, watchlist-only mode
- All tests pass ✅

## Architecture Compliance

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Protocol-based DI | ✅ | All services have protocols |
| async/await only | ✅ | Zero completion handlers |
| Actor-based services | ✅ | All services are `actor` types |
| No force unwraps (!) | ✅ | Zero found in production code |
| MVVM pattern | ✅ | ViewModels separate from Views |
| SwiftUI over UIKit | ✅ | All Views use SwiftUI |
| Value semantics | ✅ | Models immutable (queueScore fixed) |
| Test naming convention | ✅ | `test[Method]_[Scenario]_[Expected]` |

## ✅ ALL KNOWN ISSUES FIXED

All code review P0 issues have been resolved. The implementation is now production-ready.

### Completed Fixes

1. **✅ AlertService updated for RankedDeal** (Line 61-64)
   - Extract `.deal` from RankedDeal before sending notifications
   - Return type remains `[FlightDeal]` for UI compatibility
   - File: `AlertService.swift`

2. **✅ DealsRepository updated for RankedDeal** (Lines 65, 78-96)
   - Pro users: Extract `.deal` using `.map { $0.deal }`
   - Free users: apply20DealAlgorithm accepts `[RankedDeal]` and returns `[FlightDeal]`
   - File: `DealsRepository.swift`

3. **✅ Test mocks fixed**
   - `MockSmartQueueService` now returns `[RankedDeal]` with wrapped deals
   - `MockPersistenceService` updated with `isCacheValid()` and `clearAllData()`
   - Files: `AlertServiceTests.swift`, `DealsRepositoryTests.swift`

4. **✅ OSLog added to PersistenceService**
   - All `print()` statements replaced with `logger`
   - Privacy-redacted logging for production
   - File: `PersistenceService.swift`

5. **✅ Cache TTL comment corrected**
   - Updated from 30min to 5min per ARCHITECTURE.md line 335
   - File: `DealsRepository.swift` line 27
