---

## üîë KEY DECISIONS MADE

### 1. Backend Architecture: Cloudflare Workers ‚úÖ
**Decision:** Use Cloudflare Workers instead of fixing FastAPI

**Reasoning:**
- FastAPI has 32 critical issues (5 weeks to fix)
- Cloudflare Workers: 2-3 days to implement (AI can build it)
- Matches original ARCHITECTURE.md specification
- Better long-term: Edge computing, no vendor lock-in
- Free tier same as Supabase ($0 until 100K requests/day)

**Timeline Impact:** +2-3 days vs Supabase, but worth it for better architecture

### 2. iOS Version: iOS 26 with iPhone 17 Pro Max ‚úÖ
**Confirmed Available:**
- iOS 26.0 SDK: ‚úÖ Available on macOS
- iPhone 17 Pro Max simulator: ‚úÖ Available
- GitHub Actions macos-15 runner: ‚úÖ Supports iOS 26

**Configuration:**
- Deployment Target: iOS 26.0
- Test Device: iPhone 17 Pro Max
- CI Runner: macos-15 (stable) with Xcode 16

### 3. Timeline: 2-3 Weeks (Not 8-12 Weeks) ‚úÖ
**Revised Based On:**
- AI can do all coding (not user)
- User only needed for: Testing, decisions, Cloudflare account setup
- Most work can happen in parallel

**New Timeline:**
- Week 1: CI fixed, docs clean, iOS TODOs fixed, Cloudflare backend started
- Week 2: Backend complete, iOS integrated, functional app
- Week 3: Tests added (50-60% coverage), bug fixes, ready for beta

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Well
1. **Parallel Analysis:** Running 3 specialized agents found all issues quickly
2. **Tool Usage:** xcodegen made Xcode project creation reproducible
3. **GitHub Issues:** Having all 50 issues tracked provides clear roadmap
4. **Documentation:** Master planning documents give clear direction

### What Could Be Better
1. **Branch Protection:** Should have disabled temporarily for faster iteration
2. **Pre-commit Hooks:** Found TODOs after commit (but that's expected)

### Process Improvements for Day 2
1. Create feature branches for each fix
2. Test locally before pushing
3. Use draft PRs for work-in-progress
