# Cross-Agent Review Strategy:
# GitHub CODEOWNERS requires actual GitHub user accounts, so all entries map to @astrion-studio.
# AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) review via COMMENTS, not formal GitHub approvals.
#
# How Cross-Agent Review Works:
# 1. @astrion-studio is the only formal approver (GitHub requirement)
# 2. AI agents leave review comments on PRs requesting changes
# 3. Branch protection: "Require conversation resolution" blocks merges until comments resolved
# 4. Automated CI: code-reviewer agent runs quality checks via GitHub Actions
# 5. PR template guides which specialized agents should comment (ios-architect, qa-specialist, etc.)
#
# This ensures high-quality code through agent collaboration WITHOUT requiring agents to have GitHub accounts.

# Default owner for everything in the repo
* @astrion-studio
