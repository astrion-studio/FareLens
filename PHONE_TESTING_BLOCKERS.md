## üìã CAN TEST WITH (Minor Issues / Won't Break Core Flow)

All other issues are **NOT blocking** basic phone testing. You can test:
- ‚úÖ App launches and shows onboarding
- ‚úÖ Browse deals (if backend has mock data)
- ‚úÖ See deal list UI
- ‚úÖ Navigate between tabs
- ‚úÖ View watchlists UI
- ‚úÖ See settings screen
- ‚úÖ Visual design and layouts

**Safe to defer:**
- Testing issues (#97-#101, #81, #57, #12) - Tests don't affect runtime
- Backend improvements (#87-#96, #103-#109) - Won't crash app
- Refactoring (#84, #86, #55, #56, #36) - Doesn't block functionality
- Documentation (#79, #28) - Doesn't affect runtime
