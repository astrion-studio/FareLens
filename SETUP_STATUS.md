## ‚ùå Missing / Not Yet Implemented

### Code Quality Tools
- [ ] **SwiftLint** - Not installed (requires Xcode)
  - Documented in TOOLING_SETUP.md but not installed
  - Would add 50+ additional quality rules
  - Pre-commit hook shows "‚ö†Ô∏è SwiftLint not installed"

### Git Workflow
- [ ] **Feature branch workflow** - Not using branches yet
  - All commits have been direct to main or single PR branch
  - Should use: `feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/` branches
  - Documented in WORKFLOW.md but not practiced

### Issue Tracking
- [ ] **Linear CLI** - Not installed
  - Documented in TOOLING_SETUP.md
  - Not configured for this project
  - No issue tracking in place yet

### Screenshot Testing
- [ ] **UI Test target** - Not created in Xcode
  - Documented in TOOLING_SETUP.md
  - `ios-app/FareLens.xcodeproj` is empty (no project file)
  - Can't run screenshot tests without Xcode project

### Xcode Setup
- [ ] **Xcode project file** - Missing `project.pbxproj`
  - Swift source files exist but not in Xcode project
  - Prevents running tests, building app, taking screenshots
  - CI currently skips tests due to missing project

### Additional Automation
- [ ] **Screenshot automation script** - Created but can't run
  - `scripts/take-screenshots.sh` documented but not created
  - Requires Xcode project + UI tests

- [ ] **Pre-commit hook in .git/hooks** - Partial
  - Custom hook exists (from Cursor agent)
  - Different from TOOLING_SETUP.md example
  - Missing: large file check, secrets detection

## üéØ Priority Recommendations

Based on your workflow needs (automated agent review + quality gates):

### Immediate (Do Now)

1. **Disable manual PR approval requirement**
   - Current: You must approve every PR manually
   - Better: Auto-merge when CI passes + Codex reviews
   - How: GitHub settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Uncheck "Require approvals"
   - Why: You want agents to handle reviews, not manual approval

2. **Approve and merge PR #1**
   - Get the CI/CD workflows into main branch
   - Then all future changes benefit from automation

### Short-Term (Next Session)

3. **Install SwiftLint** (if you want stricter checks)
   - Adds 50+ quality rules
   - Catches more potential bugs
   - Requires: Xcode installed on your Mac

4. **Create Xcode Project**
   - Required to: build app, run tests, take screenshots
   - Currently: Swift files exist but no `.xcodeproj`
   - Impact: Can't actually run the app yet

### Long-Term (Optional)

5. **Linear Integration** (if you want issue tracking)
   - Track todos, bugs, features systematically
   - Link commits to issues
   - Not critical for solo project

6. **Screenshot Testing** (if you want UI verification)
   - Requires Xcode project first
   - Automates visual QA
   - Nice-to-have, not essential

## Current Workflow: What Actually Happens

### When You Make Changes:

1. **Local commits:**
   ```
   Your code change
   ‚Üí Pre-commit hook runs (Cursor's version)
   ‚Üí Checks iOS 26 patterns, SwiftFormat, etc.
   ‚Üí Commit succeeds if checks pass
   ```

2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```
   git push origin branch-name
   ‚Üí GitHub Actions triggered
   ‚Üí CI runs: code quality, pattern validation, tests
   ‚Üí Codex reviews and comments
   ‚Üí [CURRENTLY] Waits for your manual approval
   ‚Üí [SHOULD BE] Auto-merges if checks pass
   ```

3. **After merge:**
   ```
   Changes in main branch
   ‚Üí Protected by branch rules
   ‚Üí All commits have passed CI
   ‚Üí History preserved
   ```

## Gaps Between Documentation and Reality

### What TOOLING_SETUP.md Says vs What Exists:

| Item | Documented | Implemented | Gap |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| SwiftLint | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | Not installed |
| SwiftFormat | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | Complete ‚úì |
| Pre-commit hooks | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Different implementation |
| GitHub Actions | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | Complete ‚úì |
| Linear CLI | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | Not installed |
| Screenshot tests | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | Requires Xcode project |
| Xcode project | ‚úÖ Assumed | ‚ùå Missing | Critical gap |

## Recommended Workflow Settings

### For Solo Developer (You) with Agent-Driven Development:

**GitHub Branch Protection - Recommended Settings:**

```
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
   ‚úÖ code-quality
   ‚úÖ Automated Code Review
   ‚úÖ Run Tests (when applicable)

‚ùå Require approvals before merging
   (Uncheck this - you want automated workflow)

‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
   (Keep this - ensures Codex comments are addressed)

‚úÖ Allow auto-merge
   (Already enabled)

‚ùå Require linear history
   (Optional - keeps history clean)
```

**Why disable "Require approvals":**
- You can't evaluate code quality yourself
- CI + Codex provide automated quality gates
- You want agents to handle the workflow
- You're the only developer (no team collaboration needed)
- You can always revert commits if needed

**Safety mechanisms that remain:**
- ‚úÖ All CI checks must pass
- ‚úÖ Codex reviews every PR
- ‚úÖ Code quality validation
- ‚úÖ Pattern compliance checks
- ‚úÖ Git history for rollback
- ‚úÖ Branch protection prevents force push

## What You Should Do Next

### Option A: Minimal (Get Workflows Working)
1. Disable manual approval requirement (GitHub settings)
2. Approve PR #1 (gets CI/CD into main)
3. Continue developing with automated reviews

**Time:** 5 minutes
**Benefit:** Automated workflow active

### Option B: Standard (Add Missing Tools)
1. Do Option A
2. Install SwiftLint (stricter quality checks)
3. Create Xcode project (enable building/testing)

**Time:** 30 minutes
**Benefit:** Professional setup matching documentation

### Option C: Complete (Golden Standard)
1. Do Option B
2. Install Linear CLI (issue tracking)
3. Set up screenshot testing (visual QA)
4. Standardize pre-commit hooks

**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Benefit:** Everything from TOOLING_SETUP.md implemented

---

## My Recommendation

**For your use case (agent-driven development):**

**Do Option A now:**
- Uncheck "Require approvals" in branch protection
- Approve PR #1
- Let automated workflow handle future PRs

**Do Option B later:**
- When you want to actually run/test the app
- Requires creating Xcode project
- Not urgent for code review workflow

**Skip Option C:**
- Linear/screenshots are nice-to-have
- Not essential for your workflow
- Can add later if needed

---

## Questions to Answer

1. **Do you want to manually approve every PR?**
   - Yes ‚Üí Keep current settings
   - No ‚Üí Disable approval requirement (recommended)

2. **Do you need to run/build the app soon?**
   - Yes ‚Üí Create Xcode project (Option B)
   - No ‚Üí Stay with source files only (Option A)

3. **Do you want stricter quality checks?**
   - Yes ‚Üí Install SwiftLint (Option B)
   - No ‚Üí Current CI checks are sufficient (Option A)

## Summary

**Currently Working:**
- ‚úÖ Git + GitHub with proper structure
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions CI/CD (in PR, not merged yet)
- ‚úÖ Codex automated reviews
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks (custom version)
- ‚úÖ SwiftFormat + iOS 26 validation
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation

**Missing but Documented:**
- ‚ùå SwiftLint (optional, adds more rules)
- ‚ùå Linear CLI (optional, for issue tracking)
- ‚ùå Xcode project (required to build/run app)
- ‚ùå Screenshot testing (optional, requires Xcode)

**Critical Workflow Issue:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual approval required on every PR
- **Fix:** Disable approval requirement for automated workflow

**Next Action:** Choose Option A, B, or C above based on your priorities.
