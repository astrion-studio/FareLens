## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### Product Decisions (from PRD.md)
- ✅ Alert strategy: IMMEDIATE delivery with caps (Free: 3/day, Pro: 6/day)
- ✅ No batching, no scheduling
- ✅ Smart queue formula: `finalScore = dealScore × (1 + watchlistBoost) × (1 + airportWeight)`
- ✅ Tiebreaker: price ASC, then departure date ASC
- ✅ 12-hour deduplication window
- ✅ Quiet hours: 10pm-7am (customizable)

### Technical Decisions (from ARCHITECTURE.md)
- ✅ iOS 26.0+ with SwiftUI
- ✅ MVVM architecture
- ✅ Protocol-based dependency injection
- ✅ Actor isolation for services
- ✅ async/await (no completion handlers)
- ✅ 5-minute cache TTL
- ✅ StoreKit 2 for subscriptions

### Design Decisions (from DESIGN.md)
- ✅ Premium Minimalism with Liquid Glass
- ✅ iOS System Blue gradient (#0A84FF → #1E96FF)
- ✅ SF Pro Display/Text typography
- ✅ 8pt base grid
- ✅ Deal score badges (90+ = Excellent, 80-89 = Great, 70-79 = Good)

### Backend Decisions (from API.md)
- ✅ Cloudflare Workers (edge functions)
- ✅ Supabase (Postgres + Auth)
- ✅ Amadeus API (flight data)
- ✅ APNs (push notifications)
- ✅ Cloudflare KV (caching)
- ✅ 100% free tier for MVP

## 🔥 Critical Path to Launch

1. **Xcode Setup** → App runs on device ✅
2. **Backend MVP** → API endpoints working ✅
3. **Integration** → iOS talks to backend ✅
4. **Core Testing** → Critical flows tested ✅
5. **App Store** → Submitted and approved ✅

**Estimated time to launch: 6-8 weeks from now**
